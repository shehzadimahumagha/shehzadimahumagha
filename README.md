# Hi, I'm Mahum 👋

**Data & Business Analyst · AI Strategy · M.S. Business Analytics @ UIUC (GPA 3.85)**

I turn messy data and ambiguous business problems into decisions that actually move the needle. With 3+ years across **S&P Global** and **SaaS** environments, I've built everything from SQL data pipelines and Tableau dashboards to NLP pipelines and AI integration roadmaps — always with a clear business outcome in mind.

| **Business Analysis** | Requirements elicitation, BRDs, process mapping, stakeholder alignment |
| **AI Strategy** | AI integration roadmaps, use case scoping, build-vs-buy benchmarking |
